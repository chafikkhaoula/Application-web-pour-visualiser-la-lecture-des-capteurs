This my master's study project.
Today, Internet of Things (IoT) technology is one of the fastest growing areas in various fields, including agriculture. various fields, including agriculture. 
The IoT is improving the quality of our lives by bringing and by bringing and enabling changes in many areas of business to make them more convenient, 
smarter and with sufficient artificial intelligence. with sufficient artificial intelligence. Thanks to this technology, 
smart farming systems are undergoing a cultural shift towards a modern agriculture that is more productive, consumes less water, 
and even costs less. The main objective of my project is to use IoT in agriculture to collect data instantly (soil moisture, temperature, humidity), 
which will help to monitor certain environmental conditions remotely, efficiently, and improve the efficiency of agriculture. environmental conditions remotely, 
efficiently, and significantly improve production and thus farmers' income. farmers' income. The present prototype is developed with the ESP8266 technology, 
which includes specific sensors and a Wifi system. includes specific sensors and a Wifi module that allows collecting instantaneous data online. 
It is worth mentioning that the test of this prototype generated very accurate data, because while we collected them remotely, any environmental change was detected. 
Any environmental change was detected instantly and taken into account in making decisions by viewing the data in a web application or receive the data via SMS .
